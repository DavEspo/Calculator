# Calculator
This program is literally a calculator that takes a user's input and returns the result. The user use the +, -, *, and / operators to calculate any length operation. The user has to enter an in-fix expression and can use any amount of spacing between the operands and operators. This calculator has no built in math methods. Instead, it uses a stack for the operators and a stack for the operands and pops out the values accordingly and following the order of operations.
